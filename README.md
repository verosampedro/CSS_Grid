# CSS_Grid

## What did the exercise consist of?

The exercise consisted of recreating this screenshot (free theme, in my case I used pictures of my favorite anime) using only CSS grid.

## Procedure used

As you can see in the code, I use display grid, dividing my grid in 10 columns and 4 rows, where I can place my 11 pictures freely.
All the photographs were grouped in the HTML file, 11 pics together in a div id called "grid-container" and then, one by one in different div class called "item...".
